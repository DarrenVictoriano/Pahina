# Pahina

This is my personal website + portfolio + blog.

Under the hood this fullstack web app lets me sign-in my account and post a blog that will show up on the "Blog" page. This app renders markdown automatically with live view for when I am writing my blog. It also support live syntax highlighting.

Note: Pahina means Page in _Tagalog._
